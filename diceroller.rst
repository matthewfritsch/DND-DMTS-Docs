How to Roll the Dice
=======================================

- Once you've created a new game, click the "Roll Dice" button.
- Here, you can see an overlay with eight buttons and an input interface on the bottom, and "Enable Sum" and "Reset Sum" buttons at the top.

Rolling a Single Dice
-----------------------------
- To roll a two-sided dice (providing values 1-2 inclusive), click "Roll D2". You should find the result of this roll directly above the "Roll D2" button.
- All other "Roll D*X*" buttons function the same, differing only in the range of values you can achieve.
- The "Roll" button with a text box below it allows for variable-range dice rolling. While the D2, D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, and D20 are common in many roleplaying games, sometimes a Dungeon Master/Game Master will want to roll a dice with a personalized range. Enter the upper bound in the text box (e.g, 212) and after clicking the "Roll" button, you should see a number appear above between the inclusive range of 1 and your entered number (in this example, a number between 1 and 212 inclusive). 

Adding Multiple Dice Rolls
-----------------------------
The Sum buttons are used for keeping track of multiple rolls without adding their sums by hand; one example of this could be when a player falls off of a 150 foot cliff. In DND 5e, the rules state that "a creature takes 1D6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell", meaning a DM/GM would need to roll 15D6. In order to make this process easier, this DM/GM has the option of clicking "Enable Sum", which will add up the results of all rolls while enabled. A second click to "Enable Sum" will stop adding new results, and to clear the sum one can press the "Reset Sum" button.
