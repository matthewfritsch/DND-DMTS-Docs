Getting Started with the Toolset
===============================================

What This Project Is About
-------------------------------------------------------

- The goal of this project is to make a set of simple, quick-access tools for Dungeon Masters and Game Masters of various tabletop games (with a heavy focus on Dungeons and Dragons and similar games).
- Although there are a ton of other DND toolsets online (not to mention you could do things by hand), this particular toolset aims to be a stand-in for everyday use with:
    -  Quick access to information on monsters
    -  Easy tracking of player/monster initiative
    -  A simple, intuitive, and beautifully themed user interface 

Included Features
-------------------------------------------------------

- Some of the features included (so far) and their conveniences include:
    - Initiative Tracker
        - Buttons for adding players and monsters to the queue
        - Buttons for pulling a player/monster off of the list after their turn is over, and for starting a new round of combat
        - Relevant information on each player and monster in the queue, in order of initiative roll
    - Dice Roller
    - A List Of All Monsters From DND 5th Edition
    - Save States
