Getting Started with the Toolset
===============================================

What This Project Is About
-------------------------------------------------------

- The goal of this project is to provide a set of simple, quick-access tools for Dungeon Masters and Game Masters of various tabletop roleplaying games (with a heavy focus on Dungeons and Dragons and similar).
- Although there are a ton of other DND toolsets available online, this particular toolset aims to be a free stand-in for everyday use with:
    - Virtual dice-rolling and management of rolls individually or as a sum
    - Quick access to information on *Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition* monsters
    - Easy tracking of player/monster initiative in in-game combat scenarios
    - An extremely simple means of managing character information such as status conditions, health points, and more
    - A simple, intuitive, fantasy-themed user interface

    - Initiative Tracker
        - Buttons for adding players and monsters to the queue

        - Relevant information on each player and monster in the queue, in order of initiative roll
    - List of Players
        - Each player has a Player Name, Character Name, Character Class, Armor Class, and Health Points.
    - Dice Roller
        - Multiple buttons for rolling different kinds of dice (D4, D6, D8, etc.)
        - An "enable sum" button for adding up multiple rolls
